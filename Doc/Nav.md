# Nav

**File:** `src/components/Nav.astro`

## What it does

The primary site navigation bar. Supports plain links, dropdown menus, and full-width mega menu panels. Includes a mobile hamburger menu, scroll-aware styling, and corner accent decorations.

## Props

None — navigation links are hardcoded in the component's frontmatter as a `NavLink[]` array.

## How it works

### Link types

The nav supports three link types via a discriminated union:

| Type    | Structure                                                   |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Plain   | `{ label, href }` — renders as a simple `<a>` link         |
| Menu    | `{ label, type: "menu", id, items }` — dropdown with links |
| Mega    | `{ label, type: "mega", id, columns }` — full-width panel with grouped links |

### Layout

- Uses `section-grid-outside` (5-column grid from `global.css`) for alignment.
- The bar (`data-nav-bar`) is `fixed` at the top with `z-50`.
- Corner accents (`data-accent`) appear when scrolled.
- Mega panels sit outside the bar element so they can span the full container width.

### Scroll behavior

- On scroll past 12px, the bar gains `is-scrolled` class: adds a solid background, box shadow, and shows corner accents.
- Uses `{ passive: true }` on the scroll listener for performance.

### Desktop dropdowns

- Hover-intent pattern with configurable delays (`HOVER_ENTER: 100ms`, `HOVER_LEAVE: 150ms`).
- When a dropdown is already open, switching to another is instant (no enter delay).
- Click also toggles (keyboard/mobile friendly).
- Click outside or press Escape closes all dropdowns.

### Mobile menu

- Hamburger button toggles `data-nav-mobile` panel visibility.
- Icon swaps between hamburger and X via `hidden` class toggling.
- Links inside the mobile panel auto-close the menu on click.

### Accessibility

- Dropdown triggers have `aria-controls` pointing to their panel ID and `aria-expanded` state.
- Hamburger has `aria-label` that changes between "Open menu" and "Close menu".
- Logo link has `aria-label="Miscreants home"`.
- Escape key closes all dropdowns and the mobile menu.

## Usage

```astro
---
import Nav from "../components/Nav.astro";
---

<Nav />
```

To modify links, edit the `links` array in the component's frontmatter.

## Sub-components used

- `Logo` — SVG wordmark
- `Button` — CTA button ("Get a Demo")
- `AnnouncementBanner` — dismissible banner above the nav bar

## Notes

- The nav is `fixed`, so page content needs top padding/margin to avoid being hidden behind it.
- Mega panels use `backdrop-blur-md` and layered shadows for depth.
- The `AnnouncementBanner` is embedded directly in this component.
